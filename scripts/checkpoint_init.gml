  USEAGE:
    The checkpoint scripts are a mechanic that allows you to
    store multiple checkpoints for each room, rather than just a single
    checkpoint. Some examples of what this could be used for would be
    a warp zone, a bird statue transport like in Zelda Link To The Past,
    etc. 
  ROWS:
    0: Room number
    1: X
    2: Y

// it stores it in checkpoint_last_range_start to prevent the need to
