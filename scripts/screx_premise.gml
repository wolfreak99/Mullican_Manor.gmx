It's a game called Mullican Manor. The story is that the wealthy owner of the lovely Mullican estate, McKinley Mullican , 
recently had a heart attack and died. Before his death,  you, the main character, were great friends with Mullican, 
and he left you all his inheritance in his will. The only problem is, In order to prove it, you need a physical 
copy of the will, and the will is in a briefcase on the top floor of the manor, so you need to retrieve it from there. 
This is problematic, because the mansion is cursed. No "rumors of a curse", no "legend of a curse", it's just a widely 
known FACT that the mansion is cursed.

In this action RPG, you explore the mansion in an attempt to make it to the top floor and retrieve the will, running 
into many strange and formidable enemies, solving many perplexing puzzles, and seeing a bunch of stuff that just ain't 
natural. Can you solve the mystery of the manor and escape with the will? Only one way to find out!
