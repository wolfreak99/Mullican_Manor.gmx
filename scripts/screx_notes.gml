                What I want you to do after you do some of those tutorials is play around with 
                    the sprite editor, make a few practice ones, and find what size you feel most
                    comfortable with: 16 x 16, 32 x 32, or 64 x 64. This is fairly important because
                    the cell size you choose will be more less the standard the game will be based
                    on: The grounds will be cells of the size, and any sprites you make will need to be
                    at least this size.
                    
                Don't waste time building wall tilesets just yet, I've actually built a script
                    that will help with this, where all you'll need to do is create a corner
                    of a wall and it will rotate it and duplicate it and generate its own tileset
                    using it. I'll add it once I get home.
